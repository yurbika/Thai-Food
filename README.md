<p>
This Project is about animations, transitions and accessibility. 15% of the population has some form of disability, so with that in mind, I used react-aria-live to ensure everything is accessible as possible. The ambition of this project was not only to create a website with fancy animations with a library, but to create my own simple animations and managing them. 
</p>

</br>

<p>
I copied from the target website the menu and created my own dataset. After that,

to managing state, sayu-real-estate has everything. Continued with creating a data-set for the website, which contained to work with an api (unsplash). After building the sekleton of the program i started with implementing state management. To round up the project i styled everything responsiv with scss and converted to styled.components.

 I started with a moodboard in adobe xd and structured a visuale plan for me. Created the background, recreated the logo,searched for fitting svgs.

## <div name="design"> üî± Design </div>

<p> The Design is about understanding the fundamentals and appling them. In the process of creating the prototype, i wanted to create a modern and welcoming setup.The colours are picked in awareness of the theory of colours to build a warm and trustworthy reputation of Sayu. A fluid UI rounds everything up.</p>
