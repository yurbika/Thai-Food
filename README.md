<p>
This Project is about animations, transitions and accessibility. 15% of the population has some form of disability, so with that in mind, I used react-aria-live to ensure everything is accessible as possible. The ambition of this project was not only to create a website with fancy animations with a library, but to create my own simple animations and managing them.

<p>
I copied from the target website a part of the menu and created my own dataset. Thus, I programmed a scalable menu website. Which is also responsiv and supports rotation.

I tested the website with chrome vox and to ensure also a pleasing expierince for people with disabilities!

## <div name="design"> 🔱 Design </div>

<p>The design was about establishing an thai ambience. Colors were chosen by restaurante logo and a adjusted a little bit to thailands color platte. Also the font supports the tropic enviroment. I started with a moodboard in adobe xd and structured a visuale plan for me. Created the background, recreated the logo,searched for fitting svgs.

I worked with AI to adjust the svgs for my purpose. Also created the background myself, which represents the lotus in the top down view. The big lotus svg a accompanies through out the whole website, to ensure a perfectly clean and beautiful view.</p>
