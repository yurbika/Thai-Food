<p>
This Project is about animations, transitions and accessibility. 15% of the population has some form of disability, so with that in mind, I used react-aria-live to ensure everything is accessible as possible. The ambition of this project was not only to create a website with fancy animations with a library, but to create my own simple animations and managing them. 
</p>

</br>

<p>
I copied from the target website a part of the menu and created my own dataset. Thus, I programmed a scalable menu website. Which is also responsiv and supports rotation.To also ensure a pleasing experience for people with disabilities, the website is tested by chrome vox and axe.
</p>
  
</br>

<p>
At the end of this project, i learned alot about animations/transitions and accessibility. Realizing how important our job as developers is, I want to ensure that everybody can enjoy their user experience!

## <div name="design"> üî± Design </div>

<p>The design was about establishing a thai ambience. Colors were chosen by the restaurants logo and a adjusted a little bit to thailands color platte. Also the font supports the tropical environment. I started with a moodboard in adobe xd and structured a visuale plan for me. Created the background, recreated the logo,searched for fitting svgs on the internet.

I worked with adobe illustrator to adjust the svgs for my purpose. Furthermore the background is designed by myself. The big lotus svg accompanies throughout the whole website, to ensure a clean and esthetic flair.</p>
