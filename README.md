This Project is about giving an insight of my profound knowledge in front-end web development/programming. For the last six months i studied the basics of html/css/scss/js/react/redux. In this period of time i created little programs for the subjects i have learned. Thinking ahead i programmed everything reusable, which became very handy in this challenge.

<p>
From creating my own real-estate-data to managing state, sayu-real-estate has everything. I started with a moodboard in adobe xd and structured a visuale plan for me. Continued with creating a data-set for the website, which contained to work with an api (unsplash). After building the sekleton of the program i started with implementing state management. To round up the project i styled everything responsiv with scss and converted to styled.components.

## <div name="design"> ðŸ”± Design </div>

<p> The Design is about understanding the fundamentals and appling them. In the process of creating the prototype, i wanted to create a modern and welcoming setup.The colours are picked in awareness of the theory of colours to build a warm and trustworthy reputation of Sayu. A fluid UI rounds everything up.</p>
